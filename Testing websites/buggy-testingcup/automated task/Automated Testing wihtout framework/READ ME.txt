Description:
This folder, contains tests of website: https://buggy-testingcup.pgs-soft.com/.
There are completed tasks, from 1 to 5.

Objective:
The purpose of these tests was to perform tasks and consolidate knowledge.
The tests were written in Java with the Maven project and the Selenium library.

Remarks:
Tests are written without using a framework.
I am fully aware that a lot of code is unnecessarily duplicated. However, this is a deliberate action.
I wanted each one test case to be a separate, independent entity.
I was just focusing on checking my knowledge, to see if I was able to get the job done.
